    ///     Why are there 3 different managers?
    ///     The main idea of having 3 different managers is so that Code is easier to maintain as it is not as long, and hence
    ///     not as messy
    ///     The different manager names are distinct, which also lets the developer know which files to change for a specific
    ///     function
    ///     Though all the other managers can be together in this one file, a decision was made to separate them and instead
    ///     introduce
    ///     helper functions in the main GameManager to access the other managers more easily if required.
    ///     This is part of using the Separation of concerns design principle.
